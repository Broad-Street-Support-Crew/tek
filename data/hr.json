If you are concerned about neurotoxic effects, avoid taking classical psychedelics such as LSD, 2C-B and/or mushrooms with MDMA as they have been [shown to increase neurotoxicity in rats.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nrc.20023)", "False"],

        ["Dosage", "Opinions on the matter of dosage for your first trip may vary depending on how you ask. However, [research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308357/) that starting with small doses and increasing over time with subsequent sessions generally produced greater persisting positive effects. Consider starting with no more than **1-1.5 grams of dried cubensis, or 80-100ug of LSD.** However, bear in mind that mushrooms can naturally significantly vary in potency, and tabs of LSD are often inaccurately dosed. It's always better to be safe than sorry, so dose conservatively - there is always next time to go deeper. Also, re-assessing dosage and starting low when using drugs from a new source is highly recommended, regardless of prior experience.", "False"],
        ["Tripsitter", "A tripsitter is a trusted, sober friend who can help ease you into the psychedelic experience. It is strongly recommended to have one for your first few trips as a protective measure for both your mental and physical health. A good tripsitter most often has prior experience with the drug you intend to take and its effects, as having a sitter who is not familiar with altered states of consciousness can lead to unpleasant experiences, even if they are a close friend. However, the most vital quality of a good tripsitter is your measure of trust in them. Psychedelic experiences can put you in an extremely vulnerable state of mind, so it is important that you are comfortable expressing all thoughts and aspects of yourself to your sitter. Ideally, a good sitter should also be someone you are comfortable sitting in silence with. For more information, your sitter should read [this guide](https://tripsafe.org/psychedelic-trip-sitter-guide/) on tripsitting preparation.", "False"],
        ["Set", "Your set, or mindset, is easily one of the most important factors in ensuring a positive first experience with psychedelics. One of the most challenging aspects of a psychedelic experience is that of giving up control - those with excessive intial apprehension of the experience, rigid defense structures or considerable subsurface guilt or conflict are more likely to resist the experience, which can result in an unpleasant trip. It is recommended to be in a generally good mood both on the day you choose to trip, and for the few weeks prior to it.", "False"],
        ["Setting", "The setting for your first trip should be one you are intimately familiar with, safe and private. Generally, a house is the best place for your first trip; it can be cleaned prior to the experience (clutter and dirt can be uncomfortable), it is a controlled environment (unexpected things can be hard to deal with on psyches) and generally much safer than outdoors or in public. It is a good idea to prepare your house for your trip - as stated, cleaning can both be beneficial as a pre-trip ritual to prepare your mind, as well as avoid any potential stressors. Preparation of media or activities to enjoy when tripping is also recommended - visual documentaries, art supplies, light toys or a playlist of your favorite music are all good ideas. Eyeshades and headphones are also recommended. In addition to phyiscal aspects of your setting, you should also ensure that your schedule is free of responsibility for up to two or three days after you trip.", "False"],

You can also try some light, healthy snacks like fruit or nuts to eat on the trip\n\nTake time to properly integrate your trip before taking psychedelics again - it can take more than a month\n\nConsider getting some ginger to help alleviate any nausea\n\nWriting your dose and the time you took it on your hand in washable marker can help escape thought loops/a bad trip", "False"]

        ["About Scales", "Scales are vital to safe drug use, especially when using drugs in powder form. Estimating doses can be exceptionally inaccurate as density often varies significantly. Scales are rated by their max load and the smallest unit they measure - a milligram scale that can weigh up to 20g is a 20x0.001g scale. Milligram scales are ideal for use in measuring most drugs, 0.01g scales work for scaling substances dosed in several grams, but __should not be used for scaling anything under a gram__! Do not buy 0.1g scales as they are not accurate for 99% of drugs, and the price difference in between one and a 0.01g scale is usually negligible. It's also worth noting that just because a scale measures milligrams, it does not mean it is accurate to the exact milligram. **Anything dosed under 10-15mg, or where variance of ±10mg could be dangerous should be scaled volumetrically** - use command ``.volumetric`` for more information", "False"],
        ["Best Techniques", "Most scales come with a calibration weight - **use it.** Calibration will be off from the factory. You should calibrate your scale somewhat frequently, and especially if you take it somewhere. Instructions should come in the manual for your scale. You should also TARE your scale using the calibration weight when you are trying to weigh something - scales are most accurate at their midpoint (halfway to their max weight - i.e 10g for a 20x0.001g scale). Incidentally, many calibration weights happen to weigh exactly half of the max. You should also use the scale cover when weighing your sample, as moving air can throw off the reading. Finally, you should scale your sample multiple times and take the average weight as they will probably differ to get the best idea of the sample's weight.", "False"],
