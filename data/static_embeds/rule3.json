    "description": "Discussing drugs with a risky safety profile, very high doses, unsafe drug combinations, and other forms that goes against harm reduction values **has** to include notes and/or sources explaining its dangers. Consciously giving harmful or bad advice can result in a ban, that includes jokes.
