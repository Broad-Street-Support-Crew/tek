The first column shows serotonin innervation prior to treatment, the second shows the effects two weeks after treatment (60-90% reductions), and the third column shows the lasting effects from one binge **seven years later** (20-60% reductions). Each row is a separate monkey. The neurons that have disappeared died due to the exposure to heavy MDMA abuse, and show that these damages take a very long time to heal, potentially showing permanent deficits from just one heavy binge.", "False"]
