        ["Muscle Relief and Neuroprotection", "Magnesium is a common supplement for relieving muscle tension and will help alleviate jaw clenching. In addition to this, [it may help prevent MDMA induced neurotoxicity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044576584710128). Several forms are available [with varying degrees of efficacy.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6683096/) Chelated forms, such as magnesium glycinate/biglycinate, magnesium citrate and magnesium taurate are much more effective than common forms such as magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride (avoid these).\n\n**What is 'chelated magnesium'?**\nMagnesium is a substance that readily binds to insoluble salts in the stomach and intestines. This makes it hard to absorb in elemental form (or in forms like magnesium oxide or chloride) By binding magnesium to soluble amino acids like glycine or taurine prevents binding to the insoluble salts and massively increases bioavailability."],
        ["Recommended Dose Schedule", "100-200mg elemental magnesium twice daily for 2-3 days before taking MDMA, 100-200mg elemental magnesium 2 hours before MDMA, taken with MDMA and 2-4 hours after.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nThe information provided is only a means to raise awareness and should not be construed as medical advice.
